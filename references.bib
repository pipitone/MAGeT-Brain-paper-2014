abstract = {Classically, model-based segmentation procedures match magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to an expertly labeled atlas using nonlinear registration. The accuracy of these techniques are limited due to atlas biases, misregistration, and resampling error. Multi-atlas-based approaches are used as a remedy and involve matching each subject to a number of manually labeled templates. This approach yields numerous independent segmentations that are fused using a voxel-by-voxel label-voting procedure. In this article, we demonstrate how the multi-atlas approach can be extended to work with input atlases that are unique and extremely time consuming to construct by generating a library of multiple automatically generated templates of different brains (MAGeT Brain). We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for the mouse and human using two different nonlinear registration algorithms (ANIMAL and ANTs). The input atlases consist a high-resolution mouse brain atlas and an atlas of the human basal ganglia and thalamus derived from serial histological data. MAGeT Brain segmentation improves the identification of the mouse anterior commissure (mean Dice Kappa values ($\kappa$ = 0.801), but may be encountering a ceiling effect for hippocampal segmentations. Applying MAGeT Brain to human subcortical structures improves segmentation accuracy for all structures compared to regular model-based techniques ($\kappa$ = 0.845, 0.752, and 0.861 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, respectively). Experiments performed with three manually derived input templates suggest that MAGeT Brain can approach or exceed the accuracy of multi-atlas label-fusion segmentation ($\kappa$ = 0.894, 0.815, and 0.895 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, respectively).

abstract = {Digital atlases are commonly used in pre-operative planning in functional neurosurgical procedures performed to minimize the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. These atlases can be customized to fit an individual patient's anatomy through atlas-to-patient warping procedures. Once fitted to pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, the customized atlas can be used to plan and navigate surgical procedures. Linear, piece-wise linear and nonlinear registration methods have been used to customize different digital atlases with varying accuracies. Our goal was to evaluate eight different registration methods for atlas-to-patient customization of a new digital atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to demonstrate the value of nonlinear registration for automated atlas-based subcortical target identification in functional neurosurgery. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of two automated linear techniques, two piece-wise linear techniques (requiring the identification of manually placed anatomical landmarks), and four different automated nonlinear atlas-to-patient warping techniques (where two of the four nonlinear techniques are variants of the ANIMAL algorithm). Since a gold standard of the subcortical anatomy is not available, manual segmentations of the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus are used to derive a silver standard for evaluation. Four different metrics, including the kappa statistic, the mean distance between the surfaces, the maximum distance between surfaces, and the total structure volume are used to compare the warping techniques. The results show that nonlinear techniques perform statistically better than linear and piece-wise linear techniques. In addition, the results demonstrate statistically significant differences between the nonlinear techniques, with the ANIMAL algorithm yielding better results.},

abstract = {Digital brain atlases can be used in conjuction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) for planning and guidance during neurosurgery. Digital atlases are advantageous since they can be warped nonlinearly to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Functional neurosurgery with implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes requires accurate targeting, and has become a popular surgical technique in Parkinsonian patients. In this paper, we present a method for integrating postoperative data from subthalamic (STN) DBS implantation into an antomical atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The method estimates electrode position from post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These electrodes are then warped back into the atlas space and are modelled in three dimensions. The average of these models is then taken to show the region where the majority of STN DBS electrodes were implanted. The group with more favorable post-operative results was separated from the group which responded to the STN DBS implantation procedure less favourably to create a probablisitic distribution of DBS in the STN electrodes.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is a neuroanatomical structure that has been widely studied in the context of learning, memory, stress, and neurodegeneration. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus is subdivided into several subfields with intricate morphologies and complex three-dimensional relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated that the identification of different subfields is possible with high-resolution and -contrast image volumes acquired using ex vivo specimens in a small bore 9.4T scanner and, more recently, in vivo, at 7T. In these studies, the neuroanatomical definitions of boundaries between subfields are based upon salient differences in image contrast. Typically, the definition of subfields has not been possible using commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (i.e.: 1.5 or 3T) due to resolution and contrast limitations. To overcome the limited availability of post-mortem specimens and expertise in state-of-the-art high-field imaging, we propose a coupling of MR acquisition and detailed segmentation techniques that allow for the reliable identification of hippocampal anatomy (including subfields). High-resolution and -contrast T1- and T2-weighted image volumes were acquired from 5 volunteers (2 male; 3 female; age range: 29-57, avg. 37) using a clinical research-grade 3T scanner and have final super-sampled isotropic voxel dimensions of 0.3mm. We demonstrate that by using these acquisition techniques, our data results in contrast-to-noise ratios that are compared well with high-resolution images acquired with long scan times using post-mortem data at higher field strengths. For the subfields, the cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum/stratum moleculare, and subiculum were all labeled as separate structures. Hippocampal volumes are reported for each of the substructures and the hippocampus as a whole (range for hippocampus: 2456.72-3325.02mm3). Intra-rater reliability of our manual segmentation protocol demonstrates high reliability for the whole hippocampus (mean Dice Kappa of 0.91; range 0.90-0.92) and for each of the subfields (range of Dice Kappas: 0.64-0.83). We demonstrate that our reliability is better than the Dice Kappas produced by simulating the following errors: a translation by a single voxel in all cardinal directions and 1\% volumetric shrinkage and expansion. The completed hippocampal atlases are available freely online (info2.camh.net/kf-tigr/index.php/Hippocampus) and can be coupled with novel computational neuroanatomy techniques that will allow for them to be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects, and ultimately be utilized in different analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {Pre-operative magnetic resonance (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) image volumes are often used for planning and guidance during functional neurosurgical procedures. These operations can include the creation of lesions in the thalamus (thalamotomy) or the globus pallidus (pallidotomy), or the insertion of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the subcortical nuclei. These subcortical targets are often difficult to localize in pre-operative imaging data due to the limited resolution and contrast available in standard MRI or CT techniques. To address this problem, digital atlases of subcortical nuclei are often used to accurately identify surgical targets since they can be warped to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Targeting accuracy thus depends on the quality of the atlas-to-patient warp. In this paper, three atlas-to-patient warping techniques are compared. Two methods rely on an MRI template as an intermediary to estimate a nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation. The third is novel, and uses a pseudo-MRI derived from an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to estimate the nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation directly. The methods are compared using (1) manual segmentations of subcortical nuclei and (2) functional data from intra-operative thalamic stimulation. The results demonstrate that the template-based atlas-to-patient warping technique is the best of the three for customizing the atlas onto patient data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural variation in the neurexin-1 (NRXN1) gene increases risk for both autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. However, the manner in which NRXN1 gene variation may be related to brain morphology to confer risk for ASD or schizophrenia is unknown. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 53 healthy individuals between 18-59 years of age were genotyped at 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the NRXN1 gene. All subjects received structural MRI scans, which were processed to determine cortical gray and white matter lobar volumes, and volumes of striatal and thalamic structures. Each subject's sensorimotor function was also assessed. The general linear model was used to calculate the influence of genetic variation on neural and cognitive phenotypes. Finally, in silico analysis was conducted to assess potential functional relevance of any polymorphisms associated with brain measures. A polymorphism located in the 3' untranslated region of NRXN1 significantly influenced white matter volumes in whole brain and frontal lobes after correcting for total brain volume, age and multiple comparisons. Follow-up in silico analysis revealed that this SNP is a putative microRNA binding site that may be of functional significance in regulating NRXN1 expression. This variant also influenced sensorimotor performance, a neurocognitive function impaired in both ASD and schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the NRXN1 gene, a vulnerability gene for SCZ and ASD, influences brain structure and cognitive function susceptible in both disorders. In conjunction with our in silico results, our findings provide evidence for a neural and cognitive susceptibility mechanism by which the NRXN1 gene confers risk for both schizophrenia and ASD.},
