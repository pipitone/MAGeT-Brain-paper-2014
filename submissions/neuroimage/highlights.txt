 - We propose an automated MR image hippocampus (and subfield) segmentation method 
 - Our method is optimised for use with a small number (< 10) of training images
 - Consistent, accurate identification of the whole hippocampus and subfields
 - Validated on healthy, Alzheimer's disease, and first episode schizophrenia subjects
 - Source code and high-resolution training subfield atlases available online
